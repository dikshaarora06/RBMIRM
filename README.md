# RBMIRM
RBMIRM is designed using residual bottleneck blocks to estimate 11 leaf nutrient parameters from multispectral drone images. This is the repository for my research article titled "Precise Estimation of Rice Leaf Macro and Micro Nutrients using a Residual Block-based Multi-spectral Image Regression Model". This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of our proposed RBMIRM model for nutrient estimation from multi-spectral drone images. The code supports training and testing on crop leaf data, generating nutrient prediction results and visualizing MAE and error metrics through boxplots.
